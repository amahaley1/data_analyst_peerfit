Project Discussion

1. There is an opportunity to standardize the datesets by having a common standardized format for all clubs.
 By standardizating the format the clubs dataset would hopefully contain similar data or at the very least similar columns.

2. Trend analysis and Cohort analysis are the major forecasting opportunities for a dataset like this.Because of how the 
data is set up a simple pivot or third party analysis platform would be able to easily add insights to the data.

3. A date table would help make reporting and forecasting more robust. By being able to use time series analysis,
 I would be able to identify historical trends and forecast base on those findings.
